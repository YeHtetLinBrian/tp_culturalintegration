	<div class="reflect1">
		<h1>Reflection on the Cultural Integration knowledge</h1> 

		<p style = "font-size:20px;">I learned more about the initiatives that have been implemented by the government bodies for cultural integration, as well as the status of the Cultural Integration of Temasek Polytechnic. Although I have been a President of the International Students Group for two years, this report of systematic study on the topic enabled me to access how open the people are actually to welcoming other cultures that they are not familiar with. Moreover, I found out that food, physical interaction, games and quizzes are some of the factors that might improve cultural integration in our events (according to the surveys). Although some of the factors have been combined in events, the new proposed idea of event can possibly attract more participants and promote cultural integration significantly. <br> <br> Conducting this project has enabled me to view the concept of Cultural Integration more holistically. This knowledge shall prove useful in the workplace, where I might have to promote integration for more cultural diversity and inclusion.</p>

		<h1 style="color: red;">Reflection on the Research and Survey Conducting Skills</h1>

		<p style = "font-size:20px;"> During this project, I planned out how to conduct survey - starting with the Objectives, important variables, and questions for addressing the variables. Next, I specifically focused on creating the survey with a complete profiling section, so that upon further research, any correlation between the profile of the students and their votings / opinoions on cultural integration can be figured out. However, I found out the survey would have been more effective if I excluded the questions on the prominent festivals in Singapore. However, the survey was successful in accessing the interaction frequencies between different cultures, races, religions and nationalities. <br> <br> This survey experience will later assist me in the scholastic field or employment for my further studies / employment. <br> <br>  

		As for research conducting skills, I learned that although having a research document before writing the report helps, it is more effective and useful to plan out the structure of the report first, and then conduct the research accordingly later. This insight assists in other TP subjects that require research, and subsequently, my further studies. <br> <br>

		<h1 style="color: black;">Reflection on the Report Writing Skills</h1>

		<p style = "font-size:20px;"> This is the first report with over 20 pages that I have written as of 2022. It consists of 100 pages (including cover). <br> <br> The report was written over the span of two weeks - and I learned to structure the report better since the beginning so that the research can be conducted accordingly. Since this report is more on broadening knowledge instead of deepening, the well-structured plan of the report proved useful. Had it been a knowledge deepening research, it would have been useful to complete a research document, connecting facts and figures and afterwards, drawing meaningful conclusions. I also learned how to format the report better so that it would be neat and aesthetically pleasing to readers. Nevertheless, this report writing skills will assist me when I apply for University, Master's Degree and PhD. </p>

		<h1 style="color: red;" >Reflection on the Website Development Skills</h1>
		<p style = "font-size:20px;"> Although this is my second time writing a website using HTML and CSS, I dedicated to creating a website that would be aesthetically pleasing to readers as well as appear professional. I also learned the methods how to make hover dropdown menu, vertical timeline as well as color changing (once hovered) buttons that enable viewers to download documents. <br> <br> Moreover, I learned how to actually upload my static website online using Github.io. This e-Portfolio will be useful in showcasing as "Website Development" skills. </p>
