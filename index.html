			<p style = "font-size : 25px; font-family: Calibri">I am Ye Htet Lin (Brian Owen), an International Student studying in Temasek Polytechnic, Singapore. I also served as the President of TP International Students Group from 2021 to 2023.</p><br>

			<p style = "font-size : 25px; font-family: Calibri"> This e-Portfolio serves as my Guided Learning project. Guided Learning is a subject that allows a student to learn any field of interest in a systematic manner. My focus for the project is learning about Cultural Integration - writing a report and creating an e-Portfolio to showcase as my learning evidence. </p>

			<p style = "font-size : 25px; font-family: Calibri">Born in Myanmar, a country that inherits 135 ethnicities, I have always been fascinated by the various cultures present in my country. The diverse cultural heritage, abundance of both tangible and intangible cultural traits from the ethnicities made Myanmar an interesting landmark for tourists and cultural ambassadors. However, I grew up seeing some of my acquaintences, especially Hindus and Muslims, experience racism and xenophobia. I have always despised people discriminating one another, and as I travelled to Singapore to continue my studies and happened to learn more about culture, I realized that Singapore enforces Diversity and Inclusion. Additionally, I also realized that even in Singapore, there are still some cases of discrimination. So, how can we eventually eliminate racial/cultural discrimination? Cultural Integration could be a good start!</p><br><br><br>

			<p style = "font-size : 25px; font-family: Calibri"> My report explores what is Cultural Integration and what has been done both globally and locally (in Singapore) to improve inclusion and cultural integration. Afterwards, the cultural initiatives by Temasek Polytechnic are discussed - along with the efforts done by my CCA (TPISG) to improve Cultural Integration and how effective they have been, and an event idea for improving cultural integration is proposed. Surveys and Interviews are also included - however, they are only accessible to the TP Staff Learning Facilitators to ensure confidentiality. In this e-Portfolio, I shall only include the summary and interpretation of the survey data and interview results.</p> <br>

			<p style = "font-size : 25px; font-family: Calibri"><strong>This report only explores into the knowledge broadening aspect instead of deepening, since this is my first self-initiated report ever. <br> <br> This e-Portfolio is created with HTML and CSS instead of Wix.com.</strong></p> <br>

		<div class = "goalsIntro">Goals for this GL Project</div> <br>

		<div class="goals" style = "font-size: 30px; font-family: Calibri;">These are the goals of this GL project: <br> <br> 1 - To learn about Cultural Integration, issues, and solutions in Singapore and beyond <br> 2 - To learn about Chinese, Indian and Malay cultures (festivals, music, visual arts and dance) and how they are integrated locally <br> 3 - To learn how to contribute towards better cultural integration in TP campus <br> <br> <br> 

			<strong>Goal 1:</strong>   Achieved, the report includes research on cultural integration in the United States, efforts by the Singapore government, as well as the efforts and initiatives done by TP. <br> <br>

			<strong>Goal 2:</strong>   Achieved, there is a separate section (Chapter Two) in the report that emphasizes the Chinese, Malay and Indian cultures and how we can use those festivals, music, visual arts and dance as opportunities to promote cultural integration. However, to focus only on the cultural integration aspect, the discussed topics did not go into too much cultural detail. <br> <br>

			<strong>Goal 3:</strong>   Achieved, surveys and interviews were conducted with TP students and staff to assess the current cultural integration across the campus, the collected data was visualized, and insights and possible improvements were presented. <br> <br>
